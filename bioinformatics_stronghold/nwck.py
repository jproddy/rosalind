Distances in Trees
http://rosalind.info/problems/nwck/

Given: A collection of n trees (nâ‰¤40) in Newick format, with each tree containing at most 200 nodes; each tree Tk is followed by a pair of nodes xk and yk in Tk.

Return: A collection of n positive integers, for which the kth integer represents the distance between xk and yk in Tk.
