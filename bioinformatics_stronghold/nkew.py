'''
Newick Format with Edge Weights
http://rosalind.info/problems/nkew/

Given: A collection of n weighted trees (nâ‰¤40) in Newick format, with each tree containing at most 200 nodes; each tree Tk is followed by a pair of nodes xk and yk in Tk.

Return: A collection of n numbers, for which the kth number represents the distance between xk and yk in Tk.
