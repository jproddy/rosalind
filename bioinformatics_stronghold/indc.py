Independent Segregation of Chromosomes
http://rosalind.info/problems/indc/

Given: A positive integer nâ‰¤50.

Return: An array A of length 2n in which A[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that two diploid siblings share at least k of their 2n chromosomes (we do not consider recombination for now).
