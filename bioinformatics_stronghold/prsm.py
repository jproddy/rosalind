'''
Matching a Spectrum to a Protein
http://rosalind.info/problems/prsm/

Given: A positive integer n followed by a collection of n protein strings s1, s2, ..., sn and a multiset R of positive numbers (corresponding to the complete spectrum of some unknown protein string).

Return: The maximum multiplicity of RâŠ–S[sk] taken over all strings sk, followed by the string sk for which this maximum multiplicity occurs (you may output any such value if multiple solutions exist).
